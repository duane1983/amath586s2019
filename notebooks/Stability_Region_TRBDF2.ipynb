    "## Boundary locus approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for a LMM we can use the Boundary Locus method to find all points that could lie on the boundary of the stability region. We can try something similar for TR-BDF2.  If a point $z$ lies on the boundary of $S$ then $|R(z)| = 1$ and so $R(z) = e^{i\\theta}$ for some $\\theta$ in $[0, 2\\pi]$.  For a LMM this gave an explicit formula for $z(\\theta)$ that could be plotted in the complex plane.  For TR-BDF2, since $R(z)$ is a rational function with a quadratic denominator, we can multiply by denominator and obtain a quadratic equation that would have to be solved for $z$ for each $\\theta$.  So there will be two curves $z_1(\\theta)$ and $z_2(\\theta)$ as $\\theta$ varies. \n",

Note that when $\\theta = 0$ the two roots are at $z_1 = 0$ and $z_2 = 12$, the midpoints of these curves.  Hence if we instead choose `theta` to go from 0 to $2\\pi$, the red curve, for example, would start at the origin, go move into the upper half plane, and then jump down to the complex conjugate of the uppermost red point, before returning smoothly to the origin.  These jumps show up if we simply plot the curves and could be confusing, as seen below."
