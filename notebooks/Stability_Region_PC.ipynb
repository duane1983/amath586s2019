    "As $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, the stability region appears to approach the intersection of the unit circle and the stability region of the backward Euler method, which is the exterior of the circle of radius 1 centered at $z=1$.  This makes sense since (a) the P-C iteration converges only if $|z| \\leq 1$ and (b) if it does converge then it converges to the value $U^{n+1}$ that solves the implicit equation defining the backward Euler method. \n",

These points are equally spaced around the unit circle and the plot below confirms that the blobs are centered around these points, which are expressed as $\\omega^j$ where $\\omega = \\exp({2\\pi i/(N+2)})$."

In practice we would iterate until the fixed point iteration converges to within some tolerance.  This can only happen if $|z|<1$ so the stability region for the full method is contained in the open unit disc.  "
