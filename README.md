Applied Math 586, Spring Quarter 2019

The [Class webpage](http://staff.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2019/)
is build using the files in the `sphinx` directory, using [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

You can view rendered versions of the Jupyter notebooks from this repository at 
[this link](https://rjleveque.github.io/amath586s2019/notebooks/html/Index.html),
and the html files are also in the directory `notebooks/html`.  Note that
interactive widgets do not work when viewing notebooks this way, but many
animations do show up properly.

For more information, see the 
[Code and notebooks](http://staff.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2019/codes.html)
webpage.
