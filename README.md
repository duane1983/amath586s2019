If you want to view Jupyter notebooks, go to the `notebooks` directory and open any notebook, or start at [Index.ipynb](notebooks/Index.ipynb).

To view rendered versions of the notebooks as html pages, open
[notebooks/html/Index.html](notebooks/html/Index.html). Note that
interactive widgets do not work when viewing notebooks this way, but many
animations do show up properly.

For more information, see the 
[Code and notebooks](http://staff.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2019/codes.html)
webpage.
