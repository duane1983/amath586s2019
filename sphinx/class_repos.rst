Class GitHub Repository
=======================

All of the files that you may need to access for this class will be pushed
to the GitHub repository `amath586s2019
<https://github.com/rjleveque/amath586s2019>`_.

Git is a version control system that you might want to use for your own
work. You are encouraged to do so!  There's a list of some useful
resources at the bottom of this page.

But for the purpose of this class it
will primarily be used as an easy way to distribute materials, and you don't
necessarily need to know much more than what's on this page to use it.  


If you're not familiar with Git and/or do not have it installed on your
laptop, see `Set Up Git <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>`_ on
GitHub.  Note that GitHub is being used to host the public class repository, but
you do not need a GitHub account to clone the repository.

However, you do need Git installed for the commands below to work!

To clone this repository::

    git clone https://github.com/rjleveque/amath586s2019.git

This will create a directory `amath586s2019`.  

AM586 environment variable
--------------------------

I suggest you define an environment variable `AM586` that points to this
repository, e.g. in the bash shell::

    export AM586=/full/path/to/amath586s2019

You can put this command in the file `~/.bashrc` if you want it to be
executed every time you open a new shell.  

Then you can do, e.g. ::

    cd $AM586

to change directories to the class repository.

Below and elsewhere in these notes, `$AM586` will be used to refer to the
full path to the class repository.

To update
---------

If new files have been added to the class repository, you can get them by
doing::

    cd $AM586
    git pull

Your copy of these files
------------------------

To avoid having to worry about
**conflicts** if you change a file and the same file changes in the repository,
I suggest that you never modify the files in this directory.  Instead, 
create another directory for doing your own work, e.g. ::

    cd
    mkdir my586
    export MY586=/full/path/to/my586

Then copy any files you need to this directory before working with them, e.g. ::

    cp -r $AM586/homeworks/hw1  $MY586/

will recursively copy the directory `hw1`.

Then modify the files in the new `hw1` directory.

Once you have done the homework and want to submit files, this will be done using the Canvas Dropbox as indicated in the homework.
