Homework 4
=============================================================


Due by 11:00pm on May 21, 2019.

**Note:** Submit a pdf file via the Canvas assignment page
`Homework 4 <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1271892/assignments/4812367>`_.

- `hw4.pdf <_static/hw4.pdf>`_


- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `hw4.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (after cloning and
  perhaps doing a `git pull`, see :ref:`class_repos`) 
  as `$AM586/homeworks/hw4/hw4.tex`.  Note that this uses some macros from the 
  file `$AM586/homeworks/latex/macros.tex`.

- If you use a notebook for part or all of this, please submit both the `.ipynb`
  file and the `.html` or `.pdf` file that is generated via the `Files --> Download
  as...` menu, or with the `jupyter nbconvert` command.   
  If you use a Python script, please submit the `.py` file.
